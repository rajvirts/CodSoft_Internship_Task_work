#TASK 1 
A To-Do List application is a useful project that helps users manage
and organize their tasks efficiently. This project aims to create a
command-line or GUI-based application using Python, allowing
users to create, update, and track their to-do lists  
The application will be developed in Python, a popular programming language that is known for its simplicity and ease of use. The application will be either command-line or GUI-based, depending on the user's preference. The command-line version of the application will be a text-based interface, while the GUI version will have a graphical user interface.

The application will allow users to create, update, and track their to-do lists. Users will be able to add new tasks, edit existing tasks, and delete tasks. They will also be able to mark tasks as completed. The application will keep track of the status of each task, so users can easily see which tasks are still outstanding.

The application will be a valuable tool for users who want to manage their tasks more effectively. It will help users to stay organized and on track, and it will make it easier to get things done.
# TASK 2
Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice.
Perform the calculation and display the result.
+ for addition
- for subtraction
* for multiplication
/ for division
If the user enters an invalid operation, the code will print an error message. If the user enters a valid operation, the code will perform the calculation and display the result.

To run the code, you can save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you save the code as calculator.py,
#TASK 3

A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and

random passwords for users. This project aims to create a
password generator application using Python, allowing users to

specify the length and complexity of the password.

User Input: Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the

password. 
The code will then generate a password of the specified length using a combination of random characters. The characters that are used to generate the password are a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.

The code will then print the generated password on the screen.
